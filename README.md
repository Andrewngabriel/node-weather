## Node-weather

Node.js console application to fetch weather based on any given address.

Integrating Google's geolocation API for fetching address info (latitude, longitude) and Dark Sky API for taking
that data and fetching the weather.

I developed this program to practice node.js
If you see any problems or things that can be improved, feel free to add it in the issues section.

To use the program:
1. Download the files in the repo
2. Run the following command in the terminal once you're in the directory
   ```javascript
   npm install
   ```

Happy coding!
